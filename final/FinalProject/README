Welcome to the piano accompaniment generator program!
This program takes in a piece of piano music and generates accompaniments according to different music styles such as
Bossa Nova, Jazz Ballad, Ragtime, and so forth. 
NOTE: The option to choose any file is not functional yet, so for the time being it is only fully functional with the jingle bells piece included.
Also to see the sheet music you need a music notation software downloaded to your computer such as musescore, Dorico, or Finale.
